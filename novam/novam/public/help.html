	<h2 id="what_is_ntpg">What is NPTG?</h2>

	<p><i>National Public Transport Gazetteer (NPTG)</i> is an official UK
	dataset for places the <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/">UK Department 
	for Transport</a> and <a href="http://www.traveline.org.uk/aboutTL.htm">Traveline</a> 
	have offered to make available to the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> 
	project. The NPTG dataset contains information on about 50.000 localities in the UK. 
	Additionally to  names and locations for places the gazetteer also provides information 
	for points of interest. However, this information is only patchy and likely to be removed 
	in the future. In case you encounter a POI from NPTG it is best to 
	<a href="#what_means_hiding">hide</a> it.
	</p>
	<p>Further information about the NaPTAN/NPTG import can be found in the 
	<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Naptan">OpenStreetMap-Wiki</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="what_is_nptg_viewer">What is the NPTG-Viewer and what can I do with it?</h2>

	<p>The NPTG-Viewer allows to compare place nodes in the OSM database with localities in the NPTG
	dataset. NPTG data has not been imported into the OSM database as its hierarchy does not match
	the place hierarchy of OSM.
	</p>
	<p>E.g. the viewer can be used to find missing places in OSM, to spot erroneous place names or 
	to find double place names.
	<p>

	<h2 id="when_do_localities_match">When do localities match?</h2>

	<p>Two localities are considered to be matching if they originate from different datasets (one from OSM and the
	other one from NPTG), if they have exactly the same names and if they are not too far apart.
	</p>

	<h2 id="when_are_localities_erroneous">When are localities erroneous?</h2>

	<p>The NPTG-Viewer complains about two types of errors. First, it expects to find no more than 
	<em>one</em> matching locality for each place. Secondly, places taken from OSM are only considered valid
	if they have a name tag and a place tag set to city, town, municipality, village, hamlet, suburb, island, 
	locality or farm.
	</p>

	<h2 id="what_means_hiding">What does &ldquo;hiding&rdquo;mean?</h2>

	<p>Localities can be hidden in NPTG-Viewer to mark them as being  invalid. 
	Thus, duplicate/double localities or places
	with invalid tags can be marked. It is planned to provide lists of hidden localities that can be downloaded. These
	lists can be updated by (?) the OSM database.
	</p>
	<p>When a location is being hidden an additional comment can be made explaining the reason for hiding
	the locality.
	</p>

	<h2 id="is_it_open_source">Is the NPTG-Viewer an open-source application?</h2>

	<p>The NPTG-Viewer is meant to be open-source software. However, I did not manage to publish the
	source code. However, if you are interested in the source code please 
	<a href="mailto:christoph@mappa-mercia.org">e-mail</a> me and I'll be happy to send you the code.
	</p>

	<h2 id="further_questions">Any further questions</h2>

	<p>If you have any other questions join the 
	<a href="http://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-transit">talk-transit mailinglist</a> or
	send a message to <a href="mailto:christoph@mappa-mercia.org">christoph@mapp-mercia.org</a>.
