# NPTG-Viewer #

A viewer for comparing place names in [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/)
with data from the [National Public Transport Gazetteer](http://www.nptg.org.uk/).
This data was made available to OpenStreetMap as part of the [NaPTAN](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/NaPTAN)
import.

The NPTG-Viewer is based on an old version of [NOVAM](https://bitbucket.org/chrisboehme/novam). It is based 
on [Pylons](http://pylonshq.org) and requires a MySQL database.
